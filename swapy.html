            <p>
                SWAPY is a casual game with an action-stealth genre designed to be played in a relaxed manner without requiring too much time. 
                In this game, players are tasked by helping a capybara navigate past its sleeping enemies. 
                The main challenge lies in the unique mechanic where the capybara can only move while the enemies are asleep and must stop when they wake up to avoid detection. 
                The game features adorable animal characters, creating a light and enjoyable atmosphere in every level.
